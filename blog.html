                    <h2>Doing 1A Online at Waterloo</h2>
                    <p>posted by Mark Lin on 12/29/2020</p>
                    <p>My experience at the University of Waterloo for my 1A classes was quite satisfactory. I was fortunate 
                        enough to be among the few selected to participate in the on-campus lectures of Math 135 and 137, and
                        it made my learning more engaging and provided motivation for me to study, which many other students
                        found difficulty acquiring.
